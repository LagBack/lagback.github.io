<p><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-size:48px;">I am LagBack</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="background-color:#00FFFF;">Hello World!</span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">I am LagBack, I used to like coding alot, not that i don&#39;t like it anymore but I just feel like it isn&#39;t for me, i mean i couldn&#39;t make a unity without having to look at a tutorial online every 5 minutes, i was interested to learn it at times but as time had gone on it got a bit boring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">I still have unity download in my macbook and i had created a game recently that was pretty okay, well i didin&#39;t upload it to&nbsp;<a href="http://itch.io" target="_blank">http://itch.io</a>&nbsp;like i used to as always, but i didin&#39;t upload it simply because i thought the idea of that game was more of a mobile game and i was close to porting to a mobile, but i lost interest. and it&#39;s just gone now.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Now <font face="courier new, courier, monospace">I might still make some games (maybe) in the future, just some dumb games for fun, but don&#39;t count me on that, simply because..</font></span></p>

<p><font face="courier new, courier, monospace"><span style="font-size: 36px;">Where I do everything</span></font></p>

<p><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">I like my Macbook alot, even thought it&#39;s&nbsp;not be the best machine out there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">It&#39;s a intel core 2 duo, with 4gb ram and integrated graphics card, so yes it just isn&#39;t really mean for gaming, so even indie games, or short dumb games i use to make ran pretty bad in it (low fps) so that&#39;s another reason of me leaving game development</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Althought i don&#39;t complain at all, i think my macbook is still pretty good and sometimes can handle things pretty well for being a late 2009 white macbook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-size:36px;">What Now?</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">Now i just simply watch videos, sometimes play minecraft, maybe replay Undertale (man that was such a nice game), and maybe even brawlhalla since playing with a controller is cool, i like doing projects and fun things to try out new things but usually it doesn&#39;t end up perfectly well.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">I had a youtube channel where i used Geometry Dash (another game that really meant alot to me) but you probably guessed by know why i dont do youtube videos anymore..(cant really screen record without getting at max 15 fps) but i don&#39;t really care, sometimes i might go on discord and lurk around but that&#39;s pretty much it. (man do i need to start doing new things).</span></span></p>

<p><font face="courier new, courier, monospace">Now, there was a game that took alot of my time and to this day i still can&#39;t how much i played it.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="courier new, courier, monospace"><span style="font-size:36px;">Hypixel Skyblock</span></font></p>

<p><font face="courier new, courier, monospace">Man was that game life consuming, i literally just woke up ,played it, slept and repeat, i don&#39;t remember the exact playtime i had but i thing it might have been for a few 700 hours, now that might not seen that impressive compared to other people but that is considering i had just got my minecraft account and that was one of the first things i did after getting it, maybe one day i should revisit it or something but i kinda just sold all my stuff and lost of money as i really didint wanna play the game anymore, so my stats are kinda bad.</font></p>

<p><font face="courier new, courier, monospace">And i mean, do i need to tell you the reason i left the game? well mostly because fps issues, and believe me it wasn&#39;t minecraft lagging, but hypixel lagging, like skyblock is such a modified game and tons of people play it so, just in the hub and high end pcs sometimes struggle getting over 30 fps (alot of people made memes about that, like getting over 40 fps in the hub). But also simply cause the game was time consuming, days passed by so quickly, i think it might have been the right choice to take a break, althought it was fun.</font></p>
